Hi, I'm Greg. I work at a Subway near crater 1492-b on the asteroid Pegasus IV. 
<br>
<br>
Recently, Subway kidnapped my grandmother and demanded that I and all other
<br>
proletariats refuse to unionize. This website tells the story of our galactic battle 
<br>
with freemarket capitalism and of the heroic dream we have of a free Pegasus IV.
<br>
<br>
Join me in the struggle. Workers unite!</p>
