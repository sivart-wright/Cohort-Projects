    <b>The Real History of Subway: "On this day..." </b>
    <br>
    <br>
        On this day, in 2059, cosmic nemesis Subway began requiring 17 hour work days
        <br>
        from employees. After a short period of armed resistance, 93 former employees disappeared.
        <br>
        In a press conference, Subway stated that their dissapearance was not connected to the recent 
        <br>
        skirmish. As a gesture of good favor, Subway offered to contribute 930 dollars to the Subway Fund
        <br> 
        in their memory. Critics suggest Subway was indeed behind the dissapearance, but news outlets are 
        <br>
        unwilling to to report this claim. In the last 20 years, dozens of reporters have gone missing 
        <br>
        after making similar claims about Subway's brutal employee policies. Subway is slated to begin 
        <br>
        construction on their one-millionth restaraunt this fall, on Saturn.
